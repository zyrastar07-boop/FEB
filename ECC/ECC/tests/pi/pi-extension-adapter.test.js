/**
 * Tests for the ECC <-> Pi coding agent thin adapter (.pi/extensions/index.ts).
 *
 * This adapter was rejected once already (PR #2352) for four defects:
 *   (a) resolving hook scripts from `process.cwd()` instead of the installed
 *       ECC package root, which breaks global installs;
 *   (b) running hooks through an interpolated shell string
 *       (`exec(\`node ${scriptPath}\`)`), which breaks on paths with spaces
 *       and is a shell-injection risk;
 *   (c) using the undocumented `app.events` bus instead of the documented
 *       `pi.on(...)` lifecycle API;
 *   (d) shipping with no compatibility tests at all.
 *
 * Group 1 below reads `.pi/extensions/index.ts` as text and asserts the
 * source contract that keeps those defects from coming back. The file is
 * TypeScript loaded by Pi through jiti at runtime, so it cannot be
 * `require()`d or `import()`ed from a plain Node test — source inspection is
 * the only option available without adding a build step or a new dependency.
 *
 * Group 2 exercises ECC's real hook runner (`scripts/hooks/run-with-flags.js`)
 * with the exact argv/env shape the adapter builds, so the fix is proven by
 * behavior, not just by grep.
 *
 * Group 3 covers three fixes a code review added on top of the above: EPIPE
 * isolation on `child.stdin`, clearing stale `pendingContext` at session
 * start, and reading companion-package installs from Pi's own settings files
 * instead of `require.resolve`. Each fix gets a source-text assertion (so a
 * regression is caught even if the behavioral mirror still passes) plus a
 * real behavioral test wherever the fix is about runtime behavior rather
 * than pure control flow.
 *
 * Group 4 covers the adapter's injection of ECC's canonical engineering rules
 * into Pi's system prompt (`PORTABLE_RULE_FILES`, `loadPortableRules`,
 * `isDisabledByEnv`, and the expanded `before_agent_start` handler). The core
 * constraint under test is that rules are read at RUNTIME from the canonical
 * `rules/common/` directory of the installed package — nothing is copied or
 * generated into `.pi/`. Each test pairs a source-text assertion (so a
 * regression in the real adapter fails even if a behavioral mirror still
 * passes) with either a real-filesystem check against this repo's actual
 * `rules/common/` files or a hand-copied mirror of the adapter's own logic.
