# Command → Agent / Skill Map

This document lists each slash command and the primary agent(s) or skills it invokes, plus notable direct-invoke agents. Use it to discover which commands use which agents and to keep refactoring consistent.

| `/orchestrate` | planner, tdd-guide, code-reviewer, security-reviewer, architect | Multi-agent handoff |
| `/multi-plan` | architect (Codex/Gemini prompts) | Multi-model planning |

| `/multi-backend` | architect | Backend multi-service |
| `/multi-frontend` | architect | Frontend multi-service |
| `/multi-workflow` | architect | General multi-service |
| `/learn` | — | continuous-learning skill, instincts |
| `/learn-eval` | — | continuous-learning-v2, evaluate then save |
| `/instinct-status` | — | continuous-learning-v2 |
| `/instinct-import` | — | continuous-learning-v2 |
| `/instinct-export` | — | continuous-learning-v2 |
| `/evolve` | — | continuous-learning-v2, cluster instincts |
| `/promote` | — | continuous-learning-v2 |
| `/projects` | — | continuous-learning-v2 |
| `/skill-create` | — | skill-create-output script, git history |
| `/checkpoint` | — | verification-loop skill |
| `/verify` | — | verification-loop skill |
| `/eval` | — | eval-harness skill |
| `/test-coverage` | — | Coverage analysis |
| `/sessions` | — | Session history |
| `/setup-pm` | — | Package manager setup script |
| `/claw` | — | NanoClaw CLI (scripts/claw.js) |
| `/pm2` | — | PM2 service lifecycle |
| `/security-scan` | security-reviewer (skill) | AgentShield via security-scan skill |

## Non-Slash CLI Surfaces

| CLI surface | Primary skill/runtime | Notes |
|-------------|-----------------------|-------|
| `ecc memory init` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Initialize project, team, or user Markdown vault scopes |
| `ecc memory save` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Create unreviewed memory; body must come from stdin or a regular file |
| `ecc memory handoff` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Create a targeted, cross-harness handoff |
| `ecc memory search` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Bounded lexical search over selected vault scopes |
| `ecc memory read` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Read one memory plus derived backlinks |
| `ecc memory doctor` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory.js` | Audit malformed files, duplicate IDs, broken links, and symlinks |
| `ecc-memory-mcp` | unified-memory / `scripts/memory-mcp.mjs` | Optional stdio MCP adapter; exposes save/search/read/doctor only |

## Direct-Use Agents

| Direct agent | Purpose | Scope | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-------|-------|
| `typescript-reviewer` | TypeScript/JavaScript code review | TypeScript/JavaScript projects | Invoke the agent directly when a review needs TS/JS-specific findings and there is no dedicated slash command yet. |

## Skills referenced by commands

- **continuous-learning**, **continuous-learning-v2**: `/learn`, `/learn-eval`, `/instinct-*`, `/evolve`, `/promote`, `/projects`
- **verification-loop**: `/checkpoint`, `/verify`
- **eval-harness**: `/eval`
- **security-scan**: `/security-scan` (runs AgentShield)
- **strategic-compact**: suggested at compaction points (hooks)
- **unified-memory**: `ecc memory ...` and the opt-in `ecc-memory-mcp` server

## How to use this map

- **Discoverability:** Find which command triggers which agent (e.g. “use `/code-review` for code-reviewer”).
- **Refactoring:** When renaming or removing an agent, search this doc and the command files for references.
- **CI/docs:** The catalog script (`node scripts/ci/catalog.js`) outputs agent/command/skill counts; this map complements it with command–agent relationships.
