## Cross-Harness Memory CLI

These are `ecc` CLI commands, not slash commands. They use one inspectable
Markdown vault across Claude, Codex, Hermes, OpenClaw, Kimi, and other
harnesses.

| Command | What it does |

Pass memory bodies with `--stdin` or `--body-file`; they are intentionally not
accepted as command-line values. Recalled memories are untrusted context, not
executable instructions or policy.

## Retired Commands

These slash commands were retired in favor of skills. The command files still exist under `legacy-command-shims/commands/` for backward compatibility (not part of the default installed surface), but the maintained workflow now lives in the listed skill — invoke the skill directly instead:

| Retired command | Use this skill instead |
|---|---|
| `/tdd` | `tdd-workflow` |
| `/eval` | `eval-harness` |
| `/verify` | `verification-loop` |
| `/e2e` | `e2e-testing` |
| `/docs` | `documentation-lookup` |
| `/claw` | `nanoclaw-repl` |
| `/context-budget` | `context-budget` |
| `/devfleet` | `claude-devfleet` |
| `/orchestrate` | `dmux-workflows` and `autonomous-agent-harness` |
| `/prompt-optimize` | `prompt-optimizer` |
| `/rules-distill` | `rules-distill` |
| `/agent-sort` | `agent-sort` |

## Quick Decision Guide

```
Starting a new feature?         → /plan first, then TDD via the tdd-workflow skill
Code just written?              → /code-review
Build broken?                   → /build-fix
Need live docs?                 → the documentation-lookup skill
Session about to end?           → /save-session or /learn-eval
Resuming next day?              → /resume-session
Context getting heavy?          → the context-budget skill
Want to extract what you learned? → /learn-eval then /evolve
Running repeated tasks?         → /loop-start
```
